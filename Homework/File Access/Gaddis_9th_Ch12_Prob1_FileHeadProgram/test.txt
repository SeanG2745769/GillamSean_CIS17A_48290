The story, which contains excerpts from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy 
(The Guide) as well as the story’s plot, opens with The Guide’s slightly 
condescending description of Earth and its primitive, ape-descended inhabitants.
The beings of Earth are described as mean, overwhelmed by problems, obsessed 
with green paper, and living out a miserable existence. The narrator then 
explains how a girl, sitting in a café, has a sudden epiphany about how to make 
everything better; however, before she can relay this world-changing idea, an 
undescribed catastrophe occurs. 
The narrator points out that the story to come is not about her but about the 
catastrophe and its consequences as well as a book titled The Hitchhiker’s Guide
to the Galaxy, which is described as a text that no Earthman has ever seen. The 
Guide, one of the most popular books in the galaxy, possibly contains 
information that is not entirely true, however. The book’s success is ascribed 
to its low cost and the appearance of the words “Don’t Panic” on its cover. As 
the introduction concludes, the narrator states that The Guide plays a major 
role in events that surround the aforementioned catastrophe, which all begin at 
a house.
